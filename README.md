# Word2Vec Fine-tuning project

This project demonstrates the power of Word2Vec embeddings in NLP by analyzing a dataset of 600 tweets from the 2024 elections. Using Word2Vec with a vector size of 50, I achieved insightful results.

What makes this project stand out is its simplicity, efficiency, and speed. With a minimal dataset and straightforward preprocessing, I could visualize word relationships effectively using t-SNE in a 3D Plotly visualization.

This showcases how accessible NLP techniques like Word2Vec can be for small-scale, real-world tasks.
